## Finding Samples

[Pianobook](www.pianobook.co.uk) is a fantastic community project to provide free piano (and other instruments) samples. The samples used in the example are from a [Steinway Concert Grand in Kristiansand, Norway](https://www.pianobook.co.uk/library/kristiansand-concert-steinway/). Thank you to [Pete Malkin](https://www.petemalkin.co.uk/) for sampling this lovely instrument!
