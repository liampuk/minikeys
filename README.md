# MiniKeys

A tiny javascript library that plays the piano. [Try it out here!](http://liamp.uk/minikeys)

To use MiniKeys in a React app, you can use components from [@minikeys/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@minikeys/react)

## Building and Running

This project is a turbo monorepo. You can build and run the app using:

```
npm run build
npm run dev
```

This will begin serving the demo app at `http://localhost:5173/minikeys-demo` and the Storybook components at `http://localhost:6006/`
